= Debezium Solace Spring Cloud App

= Flow

MySQLDB -> Spring Cloud App (Sink: Debezium, Source: Solace) -> Solace

The app will collect the change log and publish it to Solace broker.

In class CdcDebeziumSourceSolaceApplication. added an exception in line 42. On every data load, app will fail after two records are processed successfully.

= Observation
If they are 10 records inserted in the database, as per logic in line 42 we are throwing exception after two records are processed. and the rest of the 8 messages are committing to offset. 

To validate, after the spring app restart, we are not getting the 8 messages as they are already committed.

= Expectation:
If they failed with the exception, Debezium shouldn't commit the message which was failed and rest of the messages should not be processed.
